# Intermediate Level

## DataWeave Transformations
* Create a flow that reads data from a CSV file and transforms it into JSON using DataWeave.
* Include error handling for invalid data.

## API Design
* Design a RESTful API using RAML or API Designer.
* Implement the API in MuleSoft and expose it for testing.

## Error Handling:
* Build a flow that simulates various types of errors (e.g., HTTP errors, custom errors) and configure error handlers to handle each case.

## Batch Processing:
* Create a batch processing job that reads data from a database, processes it, and writes the results to another location.

## Database Integration:
* Create a MuleSoft flow that connects to a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database table.

## API Gateway:
* Design an API Gateway that routes incoming requests to different backend services based on URL patterns.
* Implement rate limiting and request/response transformation in the API Gateway.

## Message Queues:
* Set up a MuleSoft application that consumes messages from a message queue (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ).
* Process the messages and send the results to a database.

## File Processing:
* Create a MuleSoft flow that watches a directory for incoming files.
* When a new file arrives, read its content and perform a specific action (e.g., transform, filter, or log).
